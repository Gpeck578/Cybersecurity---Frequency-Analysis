# Cybersecurity---Frequency-Analysis

## Instructions:
Submit your solution+code for this assignment to the Blackboard system (under Assignment->Group Project).

For the course project, you will get to work in a team of 3 - 4 students. The program must be designed and written by everyone in the team.

## Project Description:
The goal of this project is to create a program, utilizing any preferred programming language, that conducts frequency analysis on a provided ciphertext. Frequency analysis is a fundamental technique in cryptography, especially for deciphering simple substitution ciphers. Your task is to write a program that helps in decrypting the ciphertext using frequency analysis.

The following programming requirements must be met for this project:

1. Read the ciphertext from a file.
2. Implement functionality to calculate and display the frequency of letters within the ciphertext.
3. Enable users to make informed guesses to map characters from the ciphertext to corresponding characters in the plaintext.
4. While not necessarily achieving a 100% substitution, aim to replace as many characters as possible in the ciphertext with their corresponding plaintext characters.
5. Display the decrypted plaintext as comprehensively as possible, using '*' to represent unknown characters.

The first three letters are guaranteed in this order: E, T, A. However, for the remaining letters (O, I, N, S, R), their frequency may vary depending on the specific passages. For instance, you may see that 'S' occurs more frequently than 'O' in some instances.
